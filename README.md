# CopyPad-Windows
### Quickly copy and paste emoticons from your system tray! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ

## How to use
To use CopyPad, just run the executable. It'll add an icon to your system try, and you can right-click it to display a list of emoticons. Selecting one will put it on your clipboard, ready to be pasted at a moment's notice.

Left-clicking the tray icon is a shortcut for copying "ಠ_ಠ" to the clipboard.

## Adding your own emoticons / text
Adding your own pastable text is easy! Just us `emoticons.Add(@"emoticon here!")` in `ContextMenus.cs`. Recompile, and enjoy! ◕‿◕

## Tips
* Add the .exe file to the Startup folder in your Start Menu. BAM! Now you're always ready to party! ♪┌|°з°|┘♪
